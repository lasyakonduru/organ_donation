<p class="c" style="font-size:20px;">>>> What is organ donation?<br></p>
<p style="font-size:20px;margin-left: 30px">           
Organ donation is the process of surgically removing an organ or tissue from one person (the organ donor) and placing it into another person (the recipient). 
Transplantation is necessary because the recipient’s organ has failed or has been damaged by disease or injury.Organ transplantation is one of the great advances in modern medicine. Unfortunately, the need for organ donors is much greater 
than the number of people who actually donate. Every day in the United States, 21 people die waiting for an organ and more than 120,048 (www.unos.org, Nov. 1, 2016) men, women, and children await life-saving organ transplants.<br><br>         
Organ and tissue donation is more important than many of us realize—for society and for the individuals it directly affects. ... Add to these the thousands more whose lives will be improved through tissue and cornea donation and transplants that can help them move better, see better, and live better.<br>
Transplants can greatly improve a recipient's health and quality of life, allowing them to return to normal activities. They can spend more time with family and friends, be more physically active, and pursue their interests more fully.

<p class="c" style="font-size:20px;">>>> History of Organ Donation <br></p>
<p style="font-size:20px; margin: 30px"><br>
The first living organ donor in a successful transplant was Ronald Lee Herrick (1931–2010), who donated a kidney to his identical twin brother in 1954.
The lead surgeon, Joseph Murray, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990 for advances in organ transplantation. <br><br>
The youngest organ donor was a baby with anencephaly, born in 2015, who lived for only 100 minutes and donated his kidneys to an adult with renal failure.
The oldest known organ donor was a 107-year-old Scottish woman, whose corneas were donated after her death in 2016. The oldest known organ donor for an internal organ was a 92-year-old Texas man, whose family chose to donate his liver after he died of a brain hemorrhage.The oldest altruistic living organ donor was an 85-year-old woman in Britain, who donated a kidney to a stranger in 2014 after hearing how many people needed to receive a transplant. <br><br>
Researchers were able to develop a novel way to transplant human fetal kidneys into anephric rats to overcome a significant obstacle in impeding human fetal organ transplantations. The human fetal kidneys demonstrated both growth and function within the rats.</p>
