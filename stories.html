<p class="para"><i>My vision has always been impaired which affected my eyesight from birth. During my life I have received three corneal transplants in my left eye. I received my latest cornea transplant this year. My vision was kaleidoscopic before the surgery, life was increasingly blurred. Since the transplant it is becoming lot clearer. The donors and their families that help people like me are wonderful.<br><br></i><b>- Maya Agarwal, Mumbai</b></p>

<p class="para"><i>I think about you and your family every day.Your gift of organ donation has allowed me to live with purpose and appreciation.Much love always and forever.Before you the death fear filled my heart so heavily that I couldn't think much about life.After you I have found a reason to cherish it once again and enjoy the remaining fully.Thank you for giving me another life. You will always be remembered.<br><br></i><b>- Saurab Roy, Kolkata</b></p>

<p class="para"><i>Without my heart transplant,I know I wouldn't have lived to see my 18th birthday.Today I am working towards college graduation and have wonderful  plans for the future.Thank u so much!"There is one thing I know about my donor: no matter what they did while they were here on earth, they died hero. They saved my life, and that's a debt i can never repay."<br><br></i><b>- Gautham Krishna, Hyderabad</b></p>

<img src="pictures/4.jpeg" alt="4" ><br><br><br><br>
<p class="para"><i>Without the selfless generosity of the donors and their families who enabled me to receive my transplants, there is a good chance I wouldn't be here today. Words cannot express my thanks to anyone and everyone who makes the decision to be an organ and tissue donor. Some people might be worried about how organ donation sits with their religion or their beliefs, but what greater gift can there be, than to be able to save someone else's life? You may never meet the person whose life you have saved, but you will always be a hero for saving a life.<br><br></i><b>- Swarna Latha, Vishakapatnam</b></p>

<p class="para"><i>I started getting breathless and fainting. It was getting worse and worse and I felt weak. The doctors said it was my heart and I couldn't really take it in and understand it. I was carrying on as normal but things felt difficult. When they said I needed a transplant I was worried about the operation. It must have been a hard decision to donate to I am so thankful to my donor. People need to donate their organs, other people need them to live. We're very grateful to receive this heart, we know someone lost their life and we're always thinking of them.<br><br></i><b>- Nitya Iyyer, Chennai</b></p>

<p class="para"><i>I was 19 and living a normal life undertaking my last year of studies. However in late January, I started to guess there was something not quite right. I couldn't eat properly and was vomiting, my face was pale, I had weak joints and would get breathless. I was told I had a kidney failure and would get better if I had a kidney transplant. They found me a match and I received my long waited life saving transplant. I can't thank my donor enough for giving me the gift of life and allowing me to have the future i dreamed of.<br><br></i><b>- Arjun shetty, Banglore</b></p>
